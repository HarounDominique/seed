# Exit 0: guard passes, commit may proceed.
# Exit 1: guard fails, print which check and why.
#
# Default detection is by filename, not by directory: a changed file counts as
# production code if it has a recognized source extension and its name does NOT match a
# test-naming pattern; it counts as a test if its name DOES match one. This works for a
# flat-root layout (wordcount.py + test_wordcount.py) exactly the same as src/+tests/ —
# no per-project glob edit required for the common case.
#
# Override only if this project's conventions genuinely don't fit (e.g. a non-standard
# test suffix): set PRODUCTION_EXTS / TEST_NAME_PATTERNS below, or export them before
# calling this script. Do not "fix" a false FAIL by loosening these per commit — fix the
# pattern once, here, if it's genuinely wrong for every commit, never for just this one.
#
# Last test run: since an env var set by one Bash call does not survive into the next
# (each tool call is its own subprocess), the actual test verdict is read from a file,
# not an environment variable — write the real exit code to $SEED_LAST_TEST_RESULT_FILE
# (default memory-bank/.local/last-test-exit-code) right after running the suite, e.g.:
#   python -m pytest -q; echo $? > memory-bank/.local/last-test-exit-code
